With over 12 years of experience in software engineering, I am still exploring the endless capabilities of code and applying software architecture patterns to solve complex problems.

At my previous role as an engineering manager at ShareChat, I spearheaded the development of a scalable data platform by managing a team of six data engineers and collaborating with cross-functional teams. I optimized costs, improved service level agreements/objectives, and contributed to building in-house products for data ingestion into multiple sinks.
